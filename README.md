# Coding Standards
Code guidelines  help write more consistent code across a project or team. 
Use these guidelines as-is, or fork them and modify them to your liking.
Copy these guidelines to your project's repository as `coding-standards.md` for all project contributors to reference. Utilize and customize the supplied EditorConfig and linter files based upon these guidelines.
Let these guidelines grow and change as your project grows and changes.

## Code Principles
* Every line of code should appear to be written by a single person.
* Enforce the agreed-upon style. 
* Follow the rules when it makes sense — break them when it doesn't. Write all code with intent.
* Write readable and understandable code.
