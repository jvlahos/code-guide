# Code Guide
Code guidelines  help write more consistent code across a project or team. 
Use these guidelines as-is, or fork them and modify them to your liking.
Add these files to your repository for all product contributors to see and reference.

## Code Principles
* Every line of code should appear to be written by a single person.
* Enforce the agreed-upon style. 
* Follow the rules when it makes sense — break them when it doesn't. Write all code with intent.
* Write readable and understandable code.
